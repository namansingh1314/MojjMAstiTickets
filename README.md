MojMastiTickets
Welcome to the MojMastiTickets project! This React-based application replicates the core features of a ticket booking platform, inspired by the popular BookMyShow website. It aims to deliver a robust and scalable experience for booking tickets for movies, events, and shows.

Why This Project?
The recent Coldplay concert booking through BookMyShow faced significant challenges due to a high volume of requests, causing the platform to fail under heavy load. MojMastiTickets aims to address these issues by building a robust solution capable of handling millions of users without performance degradation. The goal is to create a seamless, reliable booking experience.
